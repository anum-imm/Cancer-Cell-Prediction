 a brief description of the changes made to achieve improved accuracy in the code:

1. **Algorithm Selection**: In the previous code, only Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers were used. In the improved version, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network classifiers were added, which are more complex algorithms that may capture nonlinear relationships better.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of features using StandardScaler was applied in both versions of the code. This preprocessing step ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model fitting, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

3. **Feature Selection**: Although not explicitly implemented in the provided code, feature selection can significantly impact model performance. In the improved version, adding more sophisticated algorithms might implicitly select relevant features by learning from the data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The evaluation step remained the same, where classification reports and accuracy scores were computed for each model on the test set. However, the improved version includes evaluation for additional models, providing a more comprehensive comparison of performance.

Overall, these changes aim to enhance the accuracy of the classification models by incorporating more diverse and potentially more powerful algorithms and ensuring proper data preprocessing.
